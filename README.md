This package contains a [Telemetry Logger](https://github.com/tetratelabs/telemetry)
interface compatible implementation that allows configuring logging scopes that can be
configured independently.

Take a look at [the examples](example_test.go) for more information on how to use the
structured and unstructured logging implementations.

For information on the Telemetry Logger interface, see: https://github.com/tetratelabs/telemetry
